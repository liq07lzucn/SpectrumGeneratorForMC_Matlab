## About this code  
This code is X-ray spectrum generator for monte-carlo simulation (Geant4, Gate)

## How to use it? 
1) Make a spectrum file using SpekCalc software (70.txt, 80.txt, 100.txt, 120.txt, 140.txt)  
2) Run a script : main_geant4 or main_opengate  
3) Select the spectrum file which is generated from SpekCalc  
4) Done.
